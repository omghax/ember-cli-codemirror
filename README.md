# ivy-codemirror

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IvyApp/ivy-codemirror.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IvyApp/ivy-codemirror)
[![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ivy-codemirror.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ivy-codemirror)

An [Ember](http://emberjs.com) component for the excellent [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) editor.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ivy-codemirror # install:addon for Ember CLI < 0.2.3
```

If you are using a version of Ember prior to 2.3, you will also need to install the `ember-hash-helper-polyfill` addon:

```sh
ember install ember-hash-helper-polyfill
```

## Usage

This addon provides an `ivy-codemirror` component which wraps a CodeMirror editor. You can set its `value` property to the code that you want to be displayed:

```handlebars
{{ivy-codemirror value=myCode}}
```

### Data Down, Actions Up

In the spirit of [Data Down, Actions Up](https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/10/14/best-practices-data-down-actions-up), the `value` **will not be modified directly**. Instead, when a CodeMirror `change` event occurs, a `valueUpdated` action will be sent, and will be given the new value as an argument. You might implement this action handler like so:

```handlebars
<!-- app/templates/index.hbs -->
{{ivy-codemirror value=myCode valueUpdated=(action "updateMyCode")}}
```

```javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  actions: {
    updateMyCode(newCode) {
      this.set('myCode', newCode);
    }
  }
});
```

However, for this simple use case, Ember provides the built-in `mut` helper. You could use this helper in your template instead of writing the action handler yourself, like so:

```handlebars
<!-- app/templates/index.hbs -->
{{ivy-codemirror value=myCode valueUpdated=(action (mut myCode))}}
```

### Options

`ivy-codemirror` also allows passing [options](http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#config) to CodeMirror via the `options` property. The easiest way to do this is via Ember's built-in `hash` helper, like so:

```handlebars
{{ivy-codemirror options=(hash lineNumbers=true mode="javascript")}}
```

### Themes / Modes

By default, only `codemirror.css` (CodeMirror's default theme) is included. To include more Code Mirror addons, themes, modes, and key maps, add `codemirror` options to `ember-cli-build.js` inside your app:

```js
var app = new EmberApp({
  codemirror: {
    modes: ['javascript'],
    keyMaps: ['vim'],
    addons: ['search', 'dialog', 'scroll'],
    themes: ['solarized']
  }
});
```

The above example would pull in `mode/javascript/javascript.js`, `keymap/vim.js`, `theme/solarized.css`, `addon/search/*.js`, `addon/dialog/*.js`, and `addon/scroll/*.js` from CodeMirror and add them to `vendor.js` and `vendor.css`, respectively.
